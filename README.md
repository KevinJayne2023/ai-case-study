The Rise of Autonomous Vehicles - Waymo

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
Waymo

* When was the company incorporated?
January 17, 2009 - Google Self-Driving Project (Waymo)

* Who are the founders of the company?
Sebastian Thrun and Co-Founder Anthony Levandowski

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
The idea originated from Sebastian Thrun's pioneering work in autonomous vehicles at Stanford, leading him to a career at Google working on their Self-Driving Project. The project aimed to develop autonomous driving technology, with the mission "to make it safe and easy for people and things to move around".

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Googles parent company, Alphabet, has been the primary funder of Waymo since the inception of the project in 2009. Additionally, Waymo has brought in a total of $5.5 billion in external funding from Venture Capital firms and Automotive Comapnies over the years to support the effort of autonomous vehicles. 

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
There are a multitude of problems which Waymo is trying to solve. For starters, safer driving. By leveraging artificial intelligence and robotics, we significantly reduce the likelyhood of human error and accidents on the road. 

Waymo provides convenient rides to those who are unable to drive, including the elderly, and those without a license. 

Through the use of more Waymo cars on the road, it can significaly reduce traffic congestion. With network of autonomous vehicles on the road, it can optimize transportation flows into cities.

Lastly, Waymo is trying to solve the problem of carbon emissions. The company is transitioning to an all-electric vehicle fleet.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
Waymo's immediate customers are those located in Phoenix and San Francisco, where they are currently operating commercial robo-taxi services. The company plans to expand operations to Los Angeles and Austin. 

Waymo has partnered with ride-sharing platforms such as Uber, with intent to integrate their freight truck service points, ride-sharing, and delivery services. With many e-commerce companies in need of autonomous delivery solutions are another target customer segment. 

In summary, Waymo's short term customers are ride sharing and logistic companies. The long-term appers to be the mass consumer market by partnering with automotive companies, ride-sharing and delivery platforms, and directly offering autonomous mobility services. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Waymo has many competitors, with the race to autonomous vehicles and utilization of AI and robotics on the rise. With the main competitors being - Cruise (Subsididary of GM), Aurora (Startup founded in 2017), Argo AI (Startup backed by Ford and Volkswagen), Nuro (Robotics company), Pony.ai (Chinese AI startup), Zoox (acquired by Amazon). 

The main advantage that Waymo has on it's competitors is the leading edge research and funding by Google's parent company, Alphabet. With Waymo's projects developing autonomous vehicles dating back to 2009, it's competitors have only started over the recent years. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Waymo integrates technologies in AI and Robotics to create self-driving cars. Sophisticated sensor technologies, called Lidar, paint a 3D picture of the vehicles surroundings using millions of laser pulses that measure the time it takes to bounce back off objects. Waymo's Jaguar has 29 cameras that provide a 360 degree around the vehicle and a radar system that uses frequencies to calculate an objects distance and speed. 

Waymo's perception system uses machine learning to decipher what's around the vehicle, such as pedestrians and other objects. It also has the ability to predict the possible paths other road users may take. 

Most fascinating of all, is Waymo's simulation technology. Waymo has driving over 20 billion miles in simulation, gathering data and furthering it's autonomous driving technology. 

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
Waymo is an autonomous driving technology company that utilizes AI and robotics that enable fully autonomous transportation. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
Over the last 10 years, this self-driving technology has gone from speculation and research to reality and implementation. Waymo is the leading pioneer, at the forefront of the mobility space. In 2015 Waymo has achieved being the first fully driverless ride on public roads.

Waymax, Waymo's AI simulator for research, was developed specifically for self-driving cars to leverage it's real-world driving data to model realistic agent behaviors. 

Waymo recently released Waymo Open DataSet, one of the largest autonomous driving datasets, to host challenges to advance research in furthering the technologies functionality. 

* What are the other major companies in this field?
The race to autonomous vehicles has been ongoing for years, but their are a few companies leading the forefront along with Waymo. GM's, Cruise, is one of the main competitors with similar self-driving capabilities. Most of the other companies in this field are other Automotive makers and AV startups.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
The significant impact of Waymo has yet to come, but has made an impact on bringing self-driving vehicles closer to widespread deployment. Over the coming years it may dominate the transportation industry in ride-hailing, logistics, and environmentally friendly transportation. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
One key measure of success for Waymo is the number of miles driven, currently holding 7.1 million miles driven on public roads and over 20 billion miles in simulation. This indicates the effectiveness of the cars, the technology, and applicability within the market. 

With one of the companies initiatives making driving safer, another key measure of success is it's driving record against human drivers. Safety metrics reduced bodily injury claims by 100% fewer and property damage claims by 76% fewer compared to human drivers.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
Waymo is leading the industry in autonomous vehicles compared to it's competitors. Being backed by Alphabet, Google's parent company, it has acquired the most funding and greatest minds furthering it's technological advancements. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
Delivery service has become increasingly popular, and platforms like Doordash and Uber pay humans to do the work. Amazon is also working on deploying AI drone deliveries. I'd suggest incorporating a delivery service that runs solely on AI. Perhaps a drone similar to Amazon's that attaches to the Waymo vehicle, which allows it to "drop off" a given package at peoples doorsteps. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Offering this product not only be profitable by eliminating cost of human service, it would reduce the likelyhood of error. People make mistakes all the time, but AI driven computers don't get tired, not care, or make human related mistakes. This product would also reduce the time a product reaches ones door after being ordered.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
This product would utilize Waymo's autonomous vehicle capabilities alongside Amazon's AI driven drone delivery system. With all devices hooked up to the same network, it could reduce accidents and ensure deliveries are made in efficient time. The network that both technologies run on would need to be interconnected to the same AI database - incorporating Waymo's  AI simulator, it could make real-time improvements on it's functionality over time. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
Being able to connect Waymo's self-driving cars to the same network has profound implicaitons. Each car will know where the other Waymo cars are, which can improve traffic congestion, prevent accidents, and provide more timely deliveries. Any errors made along the way will only improve with time and the AI simulator has more data to make it's predictions from.
